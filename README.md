# Speech-enabled Chatbot

## Description

The **Speech-enabled Chatbot** is an interactive application built with Streamlit that allows users to communicate with a chatbot using both **text** and **speech** input. Users can speak their queries, and the app transcribes the speech into text using a speech recognition algorithm. The chatbot then processes the input and provides a relevant response. Additionally, users can directly type their queries into the text input box for quick interaction.

This chatbot can process both **voice** and **text** inputs, making it a versatile and user-friendly solution for people who prefer speaking over typing or those in environments where typing is inconvenient.

## Features

- **Speech Input**: The app listens to your speech and transcribes it into text, mirroring your spoken words.
- **Text Input**: You can type your query into the input box for a quick response.
- **Interactive Chatbot**: After transcription, the chatbot generates a relevant response based on the user's input.
- **Real-time Responses**: Responses are displayed immediately after your input is processed.

2. **For Speech Input**: Press the "Start Recording" button to speak, and then press "Stop Recording" to display what you said.
3. **For Text Input**: Simply type your message in the input box and press enter.
